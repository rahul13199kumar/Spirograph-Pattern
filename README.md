# Description

Spirograph toy that is used to produce complex patterns using plastic cogs and colored pens . A fractal is a curve, that is developed using a recurring pattern that repeats itself infinitely on a low scale. Fractals are used for modeling structures (such as snowflakes) or for describing partly chaotic phenomena.
 parametric equation:
 
   x(t) = R[(1-k)cost + lkcos(((1-k)/k)t)],  y(t) = R[(1-k)sint - lksin(((1-k)/k)t). 
where,

   k = r/R  

R is a scaling parameter and does not affect the structure of the Spirograph.

and,

   l = p/r

   # Abstract
     
This paper offers connections between representations in a number of multisensory modes – visual, tactile and audible/musical – that explore a single underlying conceptual structure of periodicity and factorization. A number line is explored in visual, musical and tactile modes with regard to the relationship between regular periodic rhythms; then spirographic geometric patterns and the visual and musical patterns produced by the use of circular representations of musical rhythms are used to develop initial intuitions and observations. Throughout the process, the concept of conceptually-related multiple (multisensory, multimodal) representations is invoked as a way for mathematics learners to feel, hear and see mathematical concepts in depth.
