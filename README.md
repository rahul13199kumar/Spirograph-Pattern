# Description

Spirograph toy that is used to produce complex patterns using plastic cogs and colored pens . A fractal is a curve, that is developed using a recurring pattern that repeats itself infinitely on a low scale. Fractals are used for modeling structures (such as snowflakes) or for describing partly chaotic phenomena.
 parametric equation:
 
   x(t) = R[(1-k)cost + lkcos(((1-k)/k)t)],  y(t) = R[(1-k)sint - lksin(((1-k)/k)t). 
where,

   k = r/R  

R is a scaling parameter and does not affect the structure of the Spirograph.

and,

   l = p/r
